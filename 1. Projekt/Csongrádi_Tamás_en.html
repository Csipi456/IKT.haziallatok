            <p>I have a black cat, his name is Kormi.</p>
            <p>He's an adopted cat, we found him in the fall of 2018. We had a hard time to get him to us, because he was probably not treated well in his previous place. Someone wrote to the public group, that she's looking for his Kormi cat, we wrote, that he's here, but they didn't come for him, so we adopted him. They could hurt him, because he limps a little while he's walking and at first he was very afraid of when we moved suddenly.</p>

            <h2 id="tulaj">Traits</h2>
            <p>His fur is not all the same length, there are many longer strands and even some white as he gets older, but in the summer his fur turns a golden brown that glistens in the sunlight.</p>

            <p>The color of his eyes is very interesting, the original is pale green, when he's happy or he hunts, it's orange.</p>

            <p>Now he's handled, he become a nice animal, he likes snuggling up to us or being in our laps.p>

            <h2 id="etetes">Feeding</h2>
            <p>Since he is a sterilized cat, his big dry food is for a sterile cat, but of course he eats a lot of things. Unfortunately, he had already brought birds, we found out too late that it was in his mouth, he brought it into the apartment, we couldn't catching the poor bird. Since we have already tamed, he likes to eat the morsels out of our hand, one by one. His favorite is Felix and raw chicken, he usually stands on two legs for them.</p>

            <h2 id="tiszt">Bathing</h2>
            <p>The cat is a clean animal, we don't bathe him, I think, he wouldn't like it. However, it's interesting that if it rains and he comes in wet, he lets us wipe it. We clean only his ears, because he likes to roll in the sand, so we have to get the dirt out of them. He lets my mom to tease him, and if he accidentally gets hurt, which usually happens, he lets mom take care of his wound.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="nevelese">Training</h2>
            <p>The cat is uneducable, but manageable. In the past 5 years since he's been with us, he's tamed a lot, he chases the neighbor's cats less often, he also goes to the others. They socialized perfectly well with each other.</p>
            <p>He only claws us in the heat of the game, but then he hides with us immediately, almost he's apologizing.</p>

            <p>He has a separate place in the apartment, a box and a rag where he can lie down. He can hide in a box outside in the winter from the cold, my dad made this for him out of styrofoam, which is plastered and lined with hay, so he’s not cold. He likes to be in there, and we checked when he comes out: his fur is really warm, I'm sure he's not cold.</p>
            <p>And in the summer, there are boxes outside the door and on the terrace where he can lie down, because it's Disneyland for cats.</p>
            <p>In the summer, he likes to sunbathe on the terrace.</p>
