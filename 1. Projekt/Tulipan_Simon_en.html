            <br>
            <p id="Aramis">I have a bluepoint siamese macskám, called Aramis.</p>
            <p>he arrived in the spring of 2022 from a breeder at three months of age. He was always very curious, although a bit cowardly. This curiosity of his only became stronger and stronger overtime. He's a very kind creature, he likes people exceptionally and in his own ways „socialises” a lot with them. This is a common trait for his breed so it's recomended for owners, who have a lot of time to tend to their cats. The siamese cat is one of the most active cat breeds in the world! Another favorite activity of his is playing football. He likes chacing bouncy balls troughout the flat the most. At daytime he's mostly asleep, but at night he becomes active. Another trait is that these cats generally live long lives, with some specimens reaching ages up to 20.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="tulaj">Traits</h2>
            <p>His gray spots become darker in colder weathers.</p>

            <br>
            <h2 id="etetes">Feeding</h2>
            <p>he is very picky, amd just like his owner(my sister) his taste can change rapidly. He likes fish flavoured cat food the most. He likes salmon, tuna, cod amd even chicken. He drinks little to no water, rarely maybe a few laps. He doesn't like milk at all, and he doesn't even get.</p>

            <h2 id="tiszt">Bathing</h2>
            <p>We don't see the need to wash him, he cleans himself. He sometimes does need to be combed and trimming his claws is also a good idea.
            <p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="nevelese">Training</h2>
            <p>His behaviour is usually outstanding, although he can get a bit agressive in a playful mood. He doesn't tend to use his claws, if he sees what he's attacking. Rencently he likes stealing my chair. He's of a very smart breed that can be trained to many things and even to fetch, however we haven't taught him anything yet.</p>
            <p>In warmer weather we bring him down to the nearby park, so he can go exploring there a little bit.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="mtk">Ideal conditions of keeping</h2>
            <div class="row w-100">
                <img class="float-end col-lg-3 col-md-5 col-sm-12 " src="img/tolvaj.jpg" title="Aramis as he's stealing my chair" class="jobbkep">
                <img class="float-end col-lg-3 col-md-5 col-sm-12 " src="img/nez.jpg" title="Aramis stares into your soul" class="jobbkep">
            </div>
            <p>He can move freely in the flat, even though it's not the best for the state of some furniture and stuff. Since he discovered a way to get outside the cat net, we rarely let him out to the balcony. He sometimes sneaks out into the lobby when someone opens the door, in which case we let him wander around for a little bit.</p>
