A subspecies of the wild cat. A skilled predator, more than 1,000 species can be considered its prey. In addition, it is quite intelligent, it can be trained to execute simple commands or operate structures - and it is also capable of learning smaller tasks independently.</p>
                    <p>It began to live in the company of humans about 10,000 years ago, and the first depiction of its domestication occurred about 4,000 years ago in Egypt.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>There are many breeds and color variations of the cat. Both naked and tailless versions have been bred. Cats communicate using more than a hundred different sounds and body language, such as meowing ("meow"), purring, hiding, blowing, growling, and purring. Like horses and other domestic animals, cats can survive in the wild. Cats that live alone often form smaller colonies.</p>
                        <p>However, according to the reports of animal protectionists, only very few specimens can survive without an owner in the long term, most of them are destroyed by vehicles, predators, hunger, weather conditions and diseases.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, in many countries, including our country, abandoning cats and other domestic animals or intentionally removing them from their homes (similar to abusing them) is punishable. The cat plays an important role in the legends and myths of many cultures, it also appears in the ancient stories of the Egyptians, the Chinese and the Vikings. They are generally respected, but sometimes despised.</p>

                        <p>Kitten are fed by their mother until they are 8-9 weeks old, adults need 1-2 meals a day, during which they consume about 4-5 dekagrams of food per kilogram of body weight. </p>
                        <p>Cats often sleep curled up. Cats spend quite a lot of time sleeping compared to other animals, especially when they are older. Their daily sleep requirement is about 12-16 hours, but on average they sleep 13-14 hours, but some of them can sleep up to 20 hours a day. </p>
                        <img class="float-start col-lg-3 col-md-5 col-sm-12 d-none d-sm-block" src="img/kép5.jpg">
                        <p>The cat sometimes rests half-asleep, usually crouching down with its legs bent or lying down, closing its eyes, and turning its ears forward or in the direction of noises. At the end of the time spent in semi-sleep, he usually assumes a sleeping position (for example, curls up) and then falls asleep. The sleep process is similar to that of mammals and birds. In the deep sleep phase, which replaces superficial sleep, the muscles relax and the REM phase or dream phase occurs, during which the EEG signals indicating brain activity resemble those observed during wakefulness. In addition to rapid eye movements, this period can also be indicated by twitching of the skin and muscles. The approximately 6-7 minute deep sleep phase is followed by approximately 20-30 minutes of superficial sleep, at the end of which the cat sometimes wakes up and falls asleep again after changing its body position.</p>
                        <p>For the sleeping animal, the sudden awakening due to noise or other disturbing circumstances causes stress, which in the long term, often repeated, can result in mental disorders and illnesses.</p>
                        <p>Being nocturnal animals, cats (especially younger ones) often become hyperactive and playful in the evening or early morning hours. Such periods are also called "evening/night frenzy" or "half-hour frenzy".</p>
                        <p>A cat's blood temperature depends largely on its breed and its housing conditions. Thinner specimens are usually more active than their larger counterparts. The cat's normal body temperature is 38-39 °C. The cat has an increase in temperature or a fever if its body temperature reaches 39.5 °C or rises above, and if it drops below 37.5 °C, it is chilled. In comparison, a normal human body temperature is around 36.8°C. The heartbeat of a domestic cat is between 140 and 220 per minute, depending on how excited the animal is (at rest it falls between 150 and 180, which is roughly twice the heart rate of a human).</p>

                        <p>Well-fed domestic cats also hunt birds, mice, rats, scorpions and other small animals in their environment. It often happens that they even show their prey to their owner. The reason for this is unclear, but a friendly demeanor is often associated with this behavior. Cats may be hoping for praise for this symbolic display of belonging to a group. However, according to some theories, cats deduce from the fact that their human companions spend most of the day away from them that they spend their time hunting and therefore have an abundance of food.</p>
                        <p>By donating their prey, they only want to contribute to their master's food.</p>

                        <p>The teeth and digestive system of cats are adapted to eating meat. Domestic cats also require a small amount of plant food, which they occasionally get by eating grass or other plants. While bears and dogs usually supplement their diet with fruits, berries, roots and honey, cats mostly eat meat. Since all cats are unable to taste sweets due to a genetic anomaly, these animals are mostly averse to eating fruits and berries. Nevertheless, many house cats like vegetables. Commercial cat foods are primarily meat, but often contain large amounts of wheat or rice supplemented with meat by-products, minerals and vitamins. Cats sometimes gnaw on grass, leaves, shrubs or houseplants to help regurgitate indigestible food.</p>
                        <p>Cats are unable to live on a purely vegetarian diet, as they cannot produce the nutrients they need, which plants do not or only contain in small amounts. These include taurine, vitamin A (cats' bodies are unable to convert provitamin A present in large quantities in plants into vitamin A) and some fatty acids. Due to the lack of taurine, the eyes of cats slowly deteriorate, which initially causes vision problems and eventually permanent blindness.</p>

                        <p>It is well known that cats are extremely demanding when it comes to cleanliness, they can spend up to 3 hours a day cleaning themselves. Washing helps to keep the body warm, removes parasites and stimulates the blood circulation of the skin. They keep their fur clean using the papillae of their tongue and their saliva. Cat saliva cleans the coat well, but it can cause an allergic reaction in humans. Some people who are allergic to cats suffer from hay fever, asthma or skin rashes, but others do not show any symptoms. Some cats like to wash their fellow cats or even their owners. Hair swallowed during ablution and stuck together and solidified in the stomach (called bezoar stone) is occasionally regurgitated. This occurs more often in long-haired breeds, however, gagging can be avoided with a proper diet and frequent combing of the coat or grooming with a hair brush. Cats lose about the same amount of fluid during washing as during urination, so it is important to always have fresh, clean drinking water available to replace the fluid.</p>

                        <p>Cats are at risk of most degenerative, organ, old age and tumor diseases in the same way as humans.</p>
                        <p>Many diseases are only indicated by changed behavior and appearance, so it is necessary to monitor the behavior of a healthy animal. Such symptoms include loss of appetite, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, drooling, withdrawal, lethargy, agitation, noticeable meowing, hair loss, scratching, sneezing, coughing, runny eyes, runny nose, urination problems, the appearance of the third eyelid. Dehydration is also a serious disease symptom. There can be several reasons, a clearly noticeable symptom is the loosening of the skin on the back, which remains in folds when raised.</p>
                        <p>Some infectious diseases are species-specific (e.g. panleukopenia and leukosis), but rabies also endangers humans. Vaccination is available for some common infectious diseases in cats (e.g. panleukopenia, leukosis, rabies), but not for others (e.g. feline AIDS). There is a separate vaccination program for indoor and outdoor cats, which is absolutely necessary for outdoor or garden cats, and recommended for indoor cats. For people living in apartments, the chance of rabies and imported leukosis is only theoretical, but the chance of panleukopenia is real.</p>
                        <p>Diseases caused by parasites (flea, tick, mange) (e.g. Lyme disease, heartworm and babesiosis) can be prevented by using spot-on solutions or by using a flea collar. While scabies can be cured relatively easily, Lyme disease can be cured slowly and uncertainly, the the treatment of developed heartworm disease is practically hopeless, so the focus is on prevention.</p>

                        <h2 id="Tarsasviselkedes">Social Behaviour</h2>
                        <p>Most people know cats as solitary animals, but they are actually very sociable. The biggest difference between the social behavior of cats and dogs (to which they are often compared) is that cats do not have a collective survival strategy or "pack mentality"; which just means that they take care of their basic needs themselves (such as finding food on their own and defending themselves in case of attack). However, this is not antisocial behavior. Perhaps the best example of the natural behavior of cats is the organization of wild specimens into colonies, in which individual members take care of themselves.</p>
                        <img class="m-auto col-lg-6 col-md-12 d-none d-sm-blockd-none d-sm-block" src="img/kép1.png" class="kozep">
                        <br>
                        <p>Their symbiotic relationship with humans developed over millennia. Their attachment to their owner is difficult to compare with the behavior of wild cats, but what is certain is that they are aware that humans do not belong to their species (and they obviously do not consider themselves human either). This distinction is also manifested in the vocal signals and body language used when communicating with their owner. According to some opinions, from a psychological point of view, cats see humans as surrogate mothers, so adult individuals live out their lives in a kind of permanent childhood.</p>

                        <h2 id="Eletkor">Age</h2>
                        <p>Domestic cats live longer if they are not allowed outside (thus reducing the chance of injuries from fights, accidents and diseases) and if they are spayed or neutered. Indoor cats usually live between 14 and 20 years, although according to the Guinness Book of Records, the oldest known cat was 34 years old. Another important way to extend the lifespan is to feed the cat food suitable for its age and lifestyle. To compare the ages of cats and humans, one year is usually equal to 7 cat years. However, since cats develop more slowly than humans after the age of 2, the scale has been modified, counting one human year as 4 cat years. A 7-year-old specimen is considered middle-aged, and a 10-year-old specimen is considered old.</p>

                        <p>According to the Humane Society of the United States, 3-4 million cats and dogs are euthanized each year, and even more end up in animal shelters because far more animals are born than can be given homes. However, neutering and neutering can help overcome the problem of overbreeding.</p>

                        <h2>10 facts about cats</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Cats were "domesticated" in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt or something. The cat cult of the country along the Nile is known to everyone, but perhaps not such details that the wealthier ones also piled up their pets with jewelry, and the richer someone was, the more imposing collars or rather collars their pets wore. And that's not all. In ancient Egypt, if a cat died, its owner would shave its eyebrows as a sign of mourning. And if someone killed a cat on purpose or by accident, he lived with death for his deed.</li>
                            <img class="float-end col-lg-3 col-md-5 col-sm-12 d-none d-md-block  " src="img/kép3.jpg" class="jobbkep">
                            <li>The waving cat is a must-have ornament in Asian food stalls and restaurants. But who can we respect in it? Maneki-neko has several origin stories. Here's one: one day a wealthy man noticed a cat standing guard at the door of a church beckoning him as if to invite him in, and as he entered the door, lightning struck the ground where he was standing. According to some, this is how the cat raising its paws (probably about to wash) became one of the symbols of luck in the East.</li>
                            <li>The tactile hairs, i.e. the whiskers, are as long as the hairy owner is wide, so they can assess whether they can fit in a given place or not. Because it may seem that cats can be in a liquid state, this is also just part of the big scam, and it can even be a matter of life and death that they can assess how tight a place they have to squeeze themselves through. In other words, never, ever prune them. </li>
                            <li>Cats only communicate with us by meowing, not with each other, and all kinds of sounds have different meanings. And if you want to know what Cirmi is thinking, you should also pay attention to his tail, if he is wagging, then everything is fine, he is happy to see you, the question mark also means that he is friendly, but also that he has doubts, and if the wraps it around your leg, it's like a hug.</li>
                            <li>On Ernest Hemingway's former estate in Florida, there are many cats with more fingers than usual. This developmental disorder is polydactyly, i.e. many-toed, and they are the descendants of all many-toed cats (Snow White by name), which the writer received from a ship captain. </li>
                            <li>If you have a cat, you may not be surprised by the fact that our pets sleep or nap most of the day. But how much is that much? The big part means two-thirds of the day, which means that a nine-year-old cat has only been awake for three years. And yes, we are not necessarily the center of attention the rest of the time either, as they spend a third of their waking hours cleaning themselves.</li>
                            <li>If you look closely, cats' noses are not smooth, but full of small bumps. Their designs are as unique as our fingerprints, meaning no two cat noses are alike. By the way, their tongues are so rough because it makes it easier to strip even the tiniest pieces of meat from the bones. Oh, and of course it's also the most effective comb in the world... supposedly.</li>
                            <li>Unlike humans, cats can drink seawater because their kidneys can handle this salty liquid.</li>
                            <li>Most tomcats are left-handed, and the majority of female cats are right-handed (i.e. -pawed).</li>
                            <li>Cats do not taste sweet, but there are so-called their vomeronasal, also known as Jacobson's organ. This is connected to the oral cavity, which helps to detect more "special" smells. And yes, when your cat gives a silly nod, it doesn't actually hate you, it's just sniffing you.</li>
